Changes from our previous milestones:
The ER diagram and tables in M2 were complicated to meet the requirements. Used M1 ER diagram for M4, and corrected the mistakes pointed out by TA.
Added extra attributes to some entities.
Added Meal ID to make it more reasonable instead of using Name as PK because subclasses have extra attributes such as size, flavor.
Added ON DELETE CASCADE to SQL tables for Relationship to make it more sense.
